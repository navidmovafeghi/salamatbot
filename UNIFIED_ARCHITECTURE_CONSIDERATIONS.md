# Unified Architecture: Key Considerations & Design Analysis

## Executive Summary

Transitioning from dual-mode (triage/general) to a unified, intent-based system with 6 specialized categories represents a fundamental architectural shift that will significantly impact user experience, system complexity, and long-term maintainability.

## 1. Intent Classification Challenges

### Classification Accuracy Requirements
- **Critical Success Factor**: Misclassification directly impacts user trust and medical guidance quality
- **Persian Language Complexity**: Medical terminology, colloquialisms, and cultural expressions require sophisticated understanding
- **Multi-Intent Scenarios**: Users often combine concerns ("I have chest pain and want to know about my blood pressure medication")
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Need clear decision boundaries for uncertain classifications

### Classification Strategies
```
Hybrid Approach Recommended:
├── Rule-Based Fast Path (keywords, patterns)
├── AI Classification (contextual understanding)
├── User Confirmation (for ambiguous cases)
└── Dynamic Reclassification (mid-conversation)
```

### Edge Cases to Handle
- Vague symptoms spanning multiple categories
- Emergency situations requiring immediate path override
- Users switching topics mid-conversation
- Classification confidence below threshold
- Technical/network failures during classification

## 2. Technical Architecture Implications

### System Complexity Increase
- **Session State Management**: More complex state tracking across categories
- **Context Preservation**: Full conversation history needed for each specialized path
- **Inter-Module Communication**: Categories may need to share information or hand off users
- **Error Propagation**: Failures in one module shouldn't cascade to others

### Performance Considerations
- **Latency Impact**: Intent classification adds processing time to first response
- **Resource Allocation**: Different categories may have varying computational requirements
- **Caching Strategy**: Session data, classification results, and module-specific caches
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of high-usage categories vs. specialized ones

### Data Flow Architecture
```
User Message → Intent Classification → Router → Specialized Module
     ↓              ↓                    ↓            ↓
Session Store → Classification Cache → Context → Module State
     ↑                                   ↓            ↓
Global Context ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Response Aggregation ← ←
```

## 3. User Experience Challenges

### Seamless Transitions
- **Invisible Classification**: Users shouldn't feel the system "switching modes"
- **Context Continuity**: Previous conversation should inform specialized responses
- **Expectation Management**: Clear communication about what each path can/cannot do
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Easy ways to redirect when classification is wrong

### Multi-Intent Handling Strategies
1. **Primary/Secondary Detection**: Address main concern first, acknowledge secondary
2. **Sequential Processing**: Handle intents in logical medical order
3. **Hybrid Responses**: Combine insights from multiple specialized modules
4. **User Choice**: Present options when multiple paths are equally valid

### Error Recovery & Fallbacks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to general medical assistant when classification fails
- **Manual Override**: Allow users to specify their intended category
- **Reclassification**: Mid-conversation path switching when user corrects the system
- **Escalation Paths**: Clear routes to human assistance or emergency services

## 4. Category-Specific Considerations

### SYMPTOM REPORTING (Existing System)
- **Advantage**: Mature system with proven 2-stage flow
- **Challenge**: Integration with new unified architecture
- **Special Features**: Quick action buttons, emergency detection, structured triage

- **Complexity Range**: Basic anatomy to complex condition explanations
- **Visual Aids**: Potential for diagrams, illustrations

### CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT
- **Long-term Context**: Multi-session conversation continuity
- **Personalization**: Disease-specific monitoring and advice
- **Integration Potential**: Health tracking, medication reminders
- **Specialist Referrals**: Connection to appropriate medical specialists

### DIAGNOSTIC RESULT INTERPRETATION
- **High-Risk Category**: Requires careful limitation of scope
- **Educational Focus**: Help understanding, not diagnosis
- **Professional Referral**: Strong emphasis on medical consultation
- **Format Handling**: Lab values, imaging descriptions, test reports

### PREVENTIVE CARE & WELLNESS
- **Lifestyle Integration**: Diet, exercise, mental health
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Persian cultural practices and beliefs
- **Goal Setting**: Personal health objectives and tracking
- **Motivation**: Behavioral change support and encouragement

## 5. Development & Maintenance Challenges

### Module Independence vs. Integration
- **Shared Components**: Common utilities, Persian language processing, medical disclaimers
- **Specialized Logic**: Category-specific algorithms and decision trees
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests per module + integration tests for routing
- **Documentation**: Module-specific docs + unified architecture overview

### Deployment & Rollout Strategy
```
Phased Approach Recommended:
Phase 1: Build classification & routing infrastructure
Phase 2: Migrate existing symptom checker to modular structure
Phase 3: Implement basic versions of other 5 categories
Phase 4: Add specialized features and optimizations
Phase 5: Advanced integrations and cross-category features
```
